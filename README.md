#   ECE564_HW 
This is the project you will use for all four of your ECE564 homework assignments. You need to download to your computer, add your code, and then add a repo under your own ID with this name ("ECE564_HW"). It is important that you use the same project name.  Any notes, additional functions, comments you want to share with the TA and I before grading please put in this file in the correspondiing section below.  Part of the grading is anything you did above and beyond the requirements, so make sure that is included here in the README.

## HW1
Extra Features:
* Added a `NetID` property to `DukePerson`
* The `FirstName` and `LastName` text fields are not case-sensitive and whitespaces are trimmed to facilitate `find` and `update`.
* Changed the background color and added a picture Duke University
* After successfully finding a person, all of the text fields and segmented controls are auto-completed so that it's easier to do an `update`.
* After `add/update`, all the text fields and segmented controls are cleared to facilitate further operations.
* Check if `FirstName` and `LastName` are all entered before doing a find.
